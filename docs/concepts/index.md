# What is CReact?

CReact is a **declarative universal reactive runtime**.

Think n8n, but in code. Think React, but for anything.

## The Four Pillars

### Declarative
Describe **what** you want, not **how** to get it. Write JSX that represents your system's desired state, and CReact makes it happen.

### Universal
Works for AI agents, cloud infrastructure, APIs, webhooks, IoT devices, and anything else you can imagine. Write once, run anywhere.

### Reactive
Automatically responds when things change. No polling, no manual refresh. When outputs change, dependent resources update automatically.

### Runtime
Keeps running continuously, not a one-shot deployment. Handles events, recovers from crashes, and adapts to external changes.
