# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for conducting a comprehensive final analysis of the CReact MVP (Minimum Viable Product). The analysis will evaluate the current implementation, identify strengths and weaknesses, and provide actionable recommendations for improvement focusing on type safety, error handling, CLI standardization, and documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Codebase Analysis

**User Story:** As a development team, I want a thorough analysis of the current CReact MVP implementation, so that I can understand what has been built and how well it meets the original requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL examine every file in the src/ directory
2. WHEN evaluating architecture THEN the system SHALL assess adherence to the original design principles
3. WHEN reviewing implementation THEN the system SHALL identify completed features and their quality
4. WHEN assessing test coverage THEN the system SHALL evaluate the testing strategy and coverage completeness
5. WHEN examining documentation THEN the system SHALL review inline documentation and architectural decisions

### Requirement 2: Type Safety Assessment

**User Story:** As a developer using CReact, I want comprehensive type safety throughout the library, so that I can catch errors at compile time and have better IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using CReact APIs THEN all public interfaces SHALL have complete TypeScript type definitions
2. WHEN working with CloudDOM nodes THEN the system SHALL provide type-safe access to construct properties
3. WHEN using hooks THEN the system SHALL enforce proper type constraints and return types
4. WHEN integrating providers THEN the system SHALL validate provider interface compliance at compile time
5. WHEN building applications THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful type errors for incorrect usage

### Requirement 3: Error Message Traceability

**User Story:** As a developer debugging CReact applications, I want clear, traceable error messages with context, so that I can quickly identify and fix issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide error messages with component stack traces
2. WHEN deployment fails THEN the system SHALL include resource context and deployment state information
3. WHEN hooks are misused THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on correct usage
4. WHEN provider operations fail THEN the system SHALL include provider-specific context and retry information
5. WHEN circular dependencies are detected THEN the system SHALL show the complete dependency chain

### Requirement 4: CLI Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer familiar with modern CLI tools, I want CReact's CLI to follow standard conventions and patterns, so that it feels familiar and intuitive to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using CLI commands THEN the interface SHALL follow standard Unix conventions for flags and arguments
2. WHEN getting help THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive usage information and examples
3. WHEN commands fail THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate exit codes and error formatting
4. WHEN running in CI/CD THEN the system SHALL support machine-readable output formats
5. WHEN using interactive features THEN the system SHALL provide progress indicators and user feedback

### Requirement 5: Documentation Completeness

**User Story:** As a new user of CReact, I want comprehensive documentation with examples, so that I can quickly understand how to use the library effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting with CReact THEN the system SHALL provide a complete README with getting started guide
2. WHEN learning concepts THEN the system SHALL include architectural documentation explaining key principles
3. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL provide API documentation with practical examples
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN the system SHALL include common issues and solutions
5. WHEN contributing THEN the system SHALL provide development setup and contribution guidelines

### Requirement 6: Improvement Recommendations

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want prioritized recommendations for improving CReact, so that I can make informed decisions about future development efforts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing current state THEN the system SHALL identify critical issues that block production use
2. WHEN evaluating features THEN the system SHALL categorize improvements by impact and effort
3. WHEN assessing architecture THEN the system SHALL recommend structural improvements for maintainability
4. WHEN reviewing user experience THEN the system SHALL suggest enhancements for developer productivity
5. WHEN planning roadmap THEN the system SHALL provide implementation guidance for each recommendation

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer building large infrastructure projects, I want to understand CReact's performance characteristics and limitations, so that I can plan appropriate usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL evaluate rendering performance for large component trees
2. WHEN assessing scalability THEN the system SHALL identify bottlenecks in the reconciliation algorithm
3. WHEN reviewing memory usage THEN the system SHALL analyze potential memory leaks and optimization opportunities
4. WHEN evaluating deployment speed THEN the system SHALL assess state machine and provider performance
5. WHEN testing limits THEN the system SHALL document recommended usage patterns and constraints

### Requirement 8: Security and Reliability Assessment

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to understand CReact's security posture and reliability characteristics, so that I can assess its suitability for production infrastructure management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating security THEN the system SHALL assess input validation and sanitization practices
2. WHEN reviewing state management THEN the system SHALL analyze data persistence and access controls
3. WHEN assessing reliability THEN the system SHALL evaluate error recovery and rollback mechanisms
4. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL identify potential failure modes and mitigation strategies
5. WHEN reviewing dependencies THEN the system SHALL assess third-party library security and maintenance status
