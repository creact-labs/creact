# Reactive Output System Requirements

## Introduction

This feature implements a reactive output system for CReact that enables dynamic infrastructure structures based on provider outputs. Unlike React's reactive UI updates, this system is specifically designed for infrastructure dependencies where outputs from deployed resources need to trigger selective re-renders of dependent components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Output-Bound State Reactivity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want useState to act as an output placeholder that triggers re-renders only when bound to actual provider outputs, so that my infrastructure can dynamically respond to deployed resource outputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component calls `useState()` THEN the system SHALL create an output placeholder that does not trigger re-renders on initial declaration
2. WHEN `setState()` is called with a new value that differs from the current value THEN the system SHALL trigger a selective re-render of the component and its dependents
3. WHEN `setState()` is called with the same value as current THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger a re-render (idempotent behavior)
4. WHEN a component has multiple `useState` calls THEN each state change SHALL be evaluated independently for re-render triggering
5. WHEN `setState()` is called during initial render THEN the system SHALL batch the update without triggering immediate re-render

### Requirement 2: Provider Output Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want provider outputs to automatically update bound state variables and trigger re-renders, so that dependent resources can be created with actual deployed resource outputs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a provider completes deployment and returns outputs THEN the system SHALL compare new outputs with previous outputs
2. WHEN provider outputs differ from previous values THEN the system SHALL update the CloudDOM node outputs and trigger re-renders for components with bound state
3. WHEN provider outputs are identical to previous values THEN the system SHALL NOT trigger re-renders
4. WHEN multiple providers complete simultaneously THEN the system SHALL batch output updates and trigger a single re-render cycle
5. WHEN a component uses `useEffect` to bind provider outputs to state THEN output changes SHALL trigger the effect and potentially re-render

### Requirement 3: Context Propagation Reactivity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want context value changes to trigger re-renders of consuming components, so that infrastructure configuration changes propagate through the component tree.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a context provider value changes THEN the system SHALL identify all components consuming that context
2. WHEN context consumers are identified THEN the system SHALL trigger re-renders only for components whose consumed values actually changed
3. WHEN context changes propagate THEN the system SHALL maintain proper dependency order for re-rendering
4. WHEN nested contexts change THEN the system SHALL handle cascading updates correctly
5. WHEN context changes result in structural CloudDOM changes THEN the system SHALL trigger appropriate deployment planning

### Requirement 4: Selective Re-rendering Engine

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to only re-render components that are actually affected by state or output changes, so that infrastructure updates are efficient and don't cause unnecessary resource churn.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a state change occurs THEN the system SHALL identify only components that depend on that specific state
2. WHEN re-rendering components THEN the system SHALL preserve component instances that haven't changed
3. WHEN multiple state changes occur THEN the system SHALL batch re-renders into a single update cycle
4. WHEN re-rendering completes THEN the system SHALL compute CloudDOM diffs to determine actual infrastructure changes needed
5. WHEN no infrastructure changes are detected THEN the system SHALL skip deployment while maintaining updated state

### Requirement 5: Structural Change Detection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want structural changes in my JSX (adding/removing useInstance calls) to trigger re-renders and deployment planning, so that my infrastructure topology can change dynamically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSX structure changes (conditional useInstance calls) THEN the system SHALL detect CloudDOM topology differences
2. WHEN new resources are added THEN the system SHALL mark them for creation and trigger re-render
3. WHEN resources are removed THEN the system SHALL mark them for deletion and trigger re-render
4. WHEN resource props change THEN the system SHALL mark them for update and trigger re-render
5. WHEN structural changes are detected THEN the system SHALL maintain proper dependency order for deployment

### Requirement 6: Development Mode Hot Reload

**User Story:** As a developer, I want file changes in development mode to trigger re-renders and show me infrastructure changes quickly, so that I can iterate on infrastructure code efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a source file changes in dev mode THEN the system SHALL recompile and trigger full re-render
2. WHEN hot reload occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve existing state where possible
3. WHEN hot reload detects changes THEN the system SHALL show diff preview before deploying
4. WHEN hot reload completes THEN the system SHALL only deploy resources that actually changed
5. WHEN compilation errors occur THEN the system SHALL show errors without crashing the dev server

### Requirement 7: Effect Dependency Reactivity

**User Story:** As a developer, I want useEffect dependencies to trigger re-execution when their values change, so that I can respond to infrastructure state changes with side effects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN useEffect dependencies change THEN the system SHALL re-execute the effect callback
2. WHEN effect callbacks call setState THEN the system SHALL trigger re-renders if values differ
3. WHEN effects have cleanup functions THEN the system SHALL call cleanup before re-execution
4. WHEN effects depend on provider outputs THEN output changes SHALL trigger effect re-execution
5. WHEN effects run during deployment THEN the system SHALL handle async effects properly

### Requirement 8: Manual Re-render API

**User Story:** As a developer, I want programmatic control over re-rendering for testing and CLI operations, so that I can trigger infrastructure updates on demand.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN `CReact.rerender()` is called THEN the system SHALL trigger a full re-render cycle
2. WHEN manual re-render occurs THEN the system SHALL follow the same diff-based deployment logic
3. WHEN CLI commands trigger re-render THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and logging
4. WHEN testing scenarios need re-render THEN the system SHALL provide test-friendly re-render APIs
5. WHEN manual re-render is called during deployment THEN the system SHALL queue the request appropriately

### Requirement 9: Performance and Batching

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the reactive system to be performant and avoid unnecessary work, so that my infrastructure deployments are efficient even with complex dependency graphs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple state changes occur in the same tick THEN the system SHALL batch them into a single re-render
2. WHEN re-render cycles complete THEN the system SHALL use memoization to avoid redundant work
3. WHEN dependency graphs are deep THEN the system SHALL optimize traversal and updates
4. WHEN large infrastructure trees are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain reasonable performance
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide performance metrics and tracing

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the reactive system to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback, so that I can debug issues in my infrastructure code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN re-render errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with component context
2. WHEN circular dependencies are detected THEN the system SHALL prevent infinite re-render loops
3. WHEN provider errors occur during output updates THEN the system SHALL handle them without crashing
4. WHEN state updates fail THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent state and provide error feedback
5. WHEN recovery is possible THEN the system SHALL attempt to continue with partial updates
