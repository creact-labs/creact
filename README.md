## Getting Started

CReact is a meta-runtime for building domain-specific, reactive execution engines. Declare what should exist using JSX — infrastructure, side effects, AI calls — and the runtime reconciles the difference, tracking dependencies, managing lifecycle, and persisting state across restarts.

- Visit the [documentation](https://github.com/creact-labs/creact/tree/main/docs) to get started with CReact.
- Check out the [AI-Powered Website Generator](https://github.com/creact-labs/ai-powered-aws-website-generator) to see a full demo built with CReact.
